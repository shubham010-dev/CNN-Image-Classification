\# CNN Image Classification with TensorFlow



This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 object categories.



\## Technologies Used

\- Python 3.10

\- TensorFlow / Keras

\- Jupyter Notebook

\- CIFAR-10 Dataset



\## Model Architecture

Conv2D → MaxPooling → Conv2D → MaxPooling → Flatten → Dense



\## Accuracy

Achieved ~70.25% accuracy on test data



\## How to Run

1\. Install dependencies:  

&nbsp;  `pip install tensorflow notebook matplotlib`



2\. Open notebook:  

&nbsp;  `jupyter notebook cnn\_cifar10.ipynb`



\## Output

Displays model architecture, training loss/accuracy, and final predictions.
